<h3> For this project, most of it was done with basic html, in order to imbed the text to speech audio I had to research exactly how to, which took some time. I also had a slight difficulty in uploading it, but that was fixed. Inside the folder I also put in the list of sources. I wouldve preferred to have more player freedom but I could not expand on that because of time contraints. I chose to not use Audacity because I thought the quality of the audio would be too poor. 
    The structure of the site is simple, its just choosing where you go and what you say. I had to make multiple endings because one was too vague.
